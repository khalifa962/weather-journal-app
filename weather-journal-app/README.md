# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

I used the starter project (https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/weather-journal-app)

I attended the FWD zoom webinar for some help.

This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Node JS 
This project aims to create a web page that runs on a local server.
You'll have to download Express, Body-Parser and CORS!.
